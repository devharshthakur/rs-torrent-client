# 🚧 Rust Torrent Client

A **BitTorrent client** implementation in Rust, aiming to support downloading files using the BitTorrent protocol. This project is a work-in-progress and currently in its **very early phase**—core components are being built from the ground up! 🦀


📝 **This project is a Rust rewrite of the original [Go Torrent Client](https://github.com/piyushgupta53/go-torrent-client).**


## ✨ Project Goals

- **Bencode Encoding/Decoding**
  - Full support for all Bencode types:
    - Strings
    - Integers
    - Lists
    - Dictionaries
  - Robust error handling and validation

- **Torrent File Processing**
  - Parse `.torrent` files:
    - Single-file
    - Multi-file
  - Info hash calculation
  - Piece hash extraction

- **Peer Discovery & Communication**
  - HTTP tracker support
  - Peer handshake & message protocol

- **Download Functionality**
  - Piece/block management
  - Concurrent downloads
  - File assembly & storage management
