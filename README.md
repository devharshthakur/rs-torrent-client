# Rust Torrent Client

A **BitTorrent client** implementation in Rust, aiming to support downloading files using the BitTorrent protocol. This project is a work-in-progress and currently in its **very early phase**—core components are being built from the ground up!

**This project is a Rust rewrite of the original [Go Torrent Client](https://github.com/piyushgupta53/go-torrent-client).** by [Piyush Gupta](https://github.com/piyushgupta53)

## Project Status

The current implementation status and roadmap are tracked in [docs/CHECKPOINT.md](md/checkpoint.md). Please refer to it for up-to-date progress and details on what is implemented.

For the project's long-term goals and planned features, see [goals.md](md/goals.md).

## Usage

Common development tasks can be run using `just`:

- `just run` - Format code and run the application
- `just format` - Format Rust code and Markdown files
- `just build` - Format and build the project
- `just clean` - Clean build artifacts

See the `justfile` for all available commands.
